msgid "mainAboutText"
msgstr "The creation of EasyTrade is based on understanding how the market works — and what truly drives people’s trading decisions.<br>\n"
"Our theory focuses on predicting the collective behavior of active traders and the impact of news triggers on price movement.<br><br>\n\n"
"We analyzed <b>20 years of EUR/USD minute data</b> and initially tested an ARIMA forecasting model.<br>\n"
"While it identified general trends, it failed to accurately predict real market reactions to economic events.<br>\n"
"Adding technical indicators such as SMA and RSI improved analysis but still reflected past movements rather than future ones.<br><br>\n\n"
"The breakthrough came with machine learning.<br>\n"
"By training our AI models on historical data, we achieved up to <b>85% accuracy</b> in predicting market reactions.<br><br>\n\n"
"Our models are retrained weekly to maintain performance and adapt to changing market dynamics.<br>\n"
"We currently run three generations of AI models — <b>ET1</b>, <b>ET2</b>, and <b>ET3</b>, with the third being the most advanced.<br><br>\n\n"
"You can use EasyTrade for free and help us by leaving feedback after your trades.<br>\n"
"Your insights help us improve predictions and expand to other currency pairs.<br>\n"
"Subscription plans (up to <b>$30/month</b>) will be introduced later after testing and user evaluation.<br><br>\n\n"
"For any questions, use the feedback form or contact us by email.<br>\n"
"<b>Best regards, EasyTrade Team</b>"
